# ☁️ AKS Microservices Deployment with Helm, Terraform, and CI/CD

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end DevOps pipeline using **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**. It automates infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform**, containerizes a Python Flask app with **Docker**, and uses **Helm** for Kubernetes deployments. Monitoring is handled via **Prometheus + Grafana**, and CI/CD is implemented using **Azure DevOps Pipelines**.

This is a portfolio-ready, real-world microservices deployment example.
